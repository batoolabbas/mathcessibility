description: I love teaching. As a recent PhD graduate, I feel especially enthusiastic about disseminating my passion for STEM with the broader world. As an undergraduate math teacher, I felt like there were not enough resources that animated and exemplified the specific points that I was trying to get across to my students so this is my attempt to bring those ideas into life.
